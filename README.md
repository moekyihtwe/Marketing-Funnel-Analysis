# Marketing-Funnel-Analysis
Project Overview

This project analyzes lead performance and conversion efficiency across multiple marketing sources, business segments, and lead types.
The objective was to understand where qualified leads originate, how efficiently they convert into closed deals, and how long it takes for opportunities to close.

The dataset includes:

1.Lead origins (organic search, paid search, referral, etc.)

2.Lead types (online medium, big, industry, etc.)

3.Business segments (home décor, health & beauty, etc.)

4.Time-series data (monthly trends and average days to close)

Key Findings
1. Lead Conversion Summary

- A total of 7,940 leads were analyzed, with 843 converting to closed deals, resulting in an overall conversion rate of 11%.

 Top-performing origins in conversion:

- Unknown (16%)

- Direct traffic (11%)

- Paid search and Organic search (12% each)

- Channels like display and other publicities underperformed (<7%).
  

2. Lead Origin Trends (MQLs MoM)

- Leads from organic search and direct traffic were dominant contributors.

- A visible spike in early 2018, especially during February and April, suggests successful campaign activities or SEO growth periods.

- The decline after May 2018 indicates either campaign pauses or seasonality.
  

3. Deal Closing Efficiency (Speed of Conversion)

- The average days from MQL to Closed Deal decreased significantly from ~400 days in mid-2017 to just 33 days by mid-2018.

- This indicates major improvements in sales process efficiency, nurturing strategy, or lead qualification methods.
  

4. Lead Type Conversion

- Online Medium leads dominate with 39.7% of all closed deals, followed by:

- Online Big (15.1%)

- Industry (14.7%)

- Offline (12.4%)

- Smaller categories such as Online Beginner and Other contribute very little (<7%).

5. Closed Deals by Business Segment

- The most successful business segments are:

🏠 Home Décor (105 deals)

💅 Health & Beauty (93 deals)

🚗 Car Accessories (77 deals)

- Lower-performing segments include Stationery, Toys, and Small Appliances, each below 20 deals.

- Strong dominance of lifestyle-related categories shows customer interest trends.
  

**Insights**

1.Organic and Paid Search are driving both volume and quality, indicating effective marketing alignment.

2.Lead conversion time has drastically shortened, meaning the pipeline has become more efficient and focused.

3.Online Medium and Industry leads show high maturity — they may be better-qualified or more engaged customers.

4.Lifestyle categories (Home Décor, Health & Beauty) have clear traction and should remain primary focus areas for future campaigns.


**Recommendations**
1. Focus on High-ROI Channels

Continue investing in Organic and Paid Search, optimizing for keywords and campaigns that convert fastest.

Review Display and Publicity channels — possibly underperforming or misaligned with target audience.

2. Enhance Conversion Journey

Use lead scoring and retargeting for “unknown” and “direct traffic” sources to convert even higher.

Investigate what accelerated the closing time and apply those tactics (automation, CRM follow-ups, or improved nurturing) systematically.

3. Segment-Specific Campaigns

Double down on Home Décor and Health & Beauty — consider category-specific promotions and tailored landing pages.

Explore revitalizing lower segments through bundle offers or cross-category campaigns.

**Technical Approach**

The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel to evaluate lead performance across multiple dimensions — origin, type, business segment, and monthly trend. The process involved data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization to extract meaningful insights about conversion efficiency and marketing effectiveness.

1. Data Preparation

Imported raw lead data containing attributes such as lead origin, lead type, business segment, date contacted, and closed deal status.

Created calculated metrics such as conversion rate and average days to close using Excel formulas and pivot tables.

2. Metrics & KPIs

Conversion Rate (%) = (Closed Deals ÷ Total Leads) × 100

Average Days to Close = Average time difference between first contact date and closed deal date

MQLs MoM Trend = Monthly lead count by origin, visualized as an area chart

Closed Deals by Segment = Count of successful deals grouped by business category
